# ðŸª† Mui Nested Menu

## It's not perfect, but it's pretty good.

This package provides components to let you nest menu items infinitely deep. The code is an adaption from <a href="material-ui-nested-menu-item">this package</a> to work with <a href="https://mui.com">MUI version 5</a>.

[Check out the documentation here.](https://mui-nested-menu.vercel.app/)

## ðŸ“¦ Install

The code is <a href="https://github.com/steviebaa/mui-nested-menu">open source</a>, so you can use the library by copying the `src/mui-nested-menu` directory to your project (if you'd like to adapt the components) or by installing it via NPM.

```
$ npm install mui-nested-menu
```

## ðŸ›  Exports

The following items and interfaces are exported from the package:

- `NestedDropdown` - To create menu bar dropdowns.

- `ContextMenu` - For a right-click menu.

- `IconMenuItem` - A menu item which can take start and end icons.

- `NestedMenuItem` - The actual nested menu component.

- `nestedMenuItemsFromObject({(items, isOpen, handleClose)})` - Utility function which returns a list of menu items from a given array of items in the object format you see in the samples. You can then manually put this inside a `<Menu />` component.

- `MenuItemData` - An interface for the `menuItemsData` prop.
